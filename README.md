# Bengali Question Answering with Fine-Tuned GPT Model

This repository contains a project where a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model has been fine-tuned for the task of question answering in Bengali language. Additionally, a new tokenizer has been trained specifically for Bengali text to facilitate better processing and understanding.

## Overview

Question answering (QA) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves answering questions posed in natural language. Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like GPT for QA tasks involves training the model on a specific dataset related to the task at hand. This project focuses on fine-tuning a GPT model for Bengali QA.

## Dataset

The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of Bengali language text paired with corresponding questions and answers. The dataset has been pre-processed to ensure compatibility with the GPT architecture and to facilitate effective training.

## Model Architecture

The GPT model used in this project is based on the transformer architecture, which has shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. The model architecture consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies in the input text.

## Tokenization

To effectively process Bengali text, a new tokenizer has been trained specifically for this language. Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP tasks, where text is divided into smaller units for processing. The custom tokenizer ensures accurate representation of Bengali text, enabling the model to better understand and generate responses.

## Training Process

The training process involves fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT model on the Bengali QA dataset. The model is trained using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss function and improve performance on the QA task.

## Evaluation

The performance of the fine-tuned model is evaluated using standard metrics for question answering tasks, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is tested on a separate evaluation dataset to assess its ability to accurately answer questions in Bengali.

## Results

The results of the trained model demonstrate its effectiveness in answering questions in Bengali language. Performance metrics indicate high accuracy and effectiveness in understanding and generating responses to a wide range of questions.

## Usage

To use the fine-tuned GPT model for Bengali question answering, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Load the trained model and tokenizer.
4. Provide input text and questions in Bengali language.
5. Obtain answers generated by the model for the given questions.

## Future Work

In future iterations of this project, improvements can be made to the model architecture, training process, and dataset to further enhance performance on Bengali question answering tasks. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned on larger datasets to improve its ability to understand and generate accurate responses.
